Answers to frequently asked questions.

## When should I open an issue versus a pull request (PR)?

### Open PR

Generally speaking, if you know how to open a PR in order to fix the issue, doing that is best. However, we recognise that it requires knowledge of GitHub and code to some degree, which is a form of gatekeeping. We're currently working on ways to improve/remove this barrier to entry. We also are always willing to help if you'd like to learn. Reach out via our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/selfdefined/shared_invite/zt-fczgm8b6-8ZZgHvLutNDXo~NjwaL7Iw)

### Open Issue

- Concern or question around a term that you don't have clear prescriptive feedback around
- Adding a new term that is not yet listed (with or without definition)
- Adding/enhancing a feature that you're unsure is desired

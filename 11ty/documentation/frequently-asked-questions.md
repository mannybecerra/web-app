Answers to frequently asked questions.

## When should I open an issue versus a pull request (PR)?

### Open PR

Some examples of when you may want to open a PR

- Correct misspellings
- Fix broken links
- Add definitions/nuance/translations to words that exist on the site already but are undefined/partially defined/could use more nuance
- Resolve issues that already exist

Generally speaking, if you know how to open a PR in order to fix the issue, doing that is best. However, we recognise that it requires knowledge of GitHub and code to some degree, which is a form of gatekeeping. We're currently working on ways to improve/remove this barrier to entry. We also are always willing to help if you'd like to learn. Reach out via our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/selfdefined/shared_invite/zt-fczgm8b6-8ZZgHvLutNDXo~NjwaL7Iw)

### Open Issue

- Are not sure how to open a PR but have a suggestion
- Express concern or ask a question around a term that you don't have clear prescriptive feedback around
- Add a new term that is not yet listed (with or without definition)
- Add or enhance a feature that you're unsure is desired

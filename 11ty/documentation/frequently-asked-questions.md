Answers to frequently asked questions.

## When should I open an issue versus a pull request (PR)?

### Open PR

- Correct misspellings
- Fix broken links
- Add definitions/nuance/translations to words that exist on the site already but are undefined/partially defined/could use more nuance
- Resolve issues that already exist

### Open Issue

- Concern or question around a term that you don't have clear prescriptive feedback around
- Adding a new term that is not yet listed (with or without definition)
- Adding/enhancing a feature that you're unsure is desired
